Building the C-Ensemble library

  The library has been built and tests on a linux-i386 (Redhat 7.0)
  platform.  It is compiled by doing the following in this directory:

    ./configure
    make depend
    make

  The resulting objects are the C-Ensemble library (lib/libens.a) and
  several test programs (demo/rand, demo/fifo).

  For examples of running a C-Ensemble based application program, see
  the tutorial in dlm/README.


Building the HOT library

  The C-Ensemble HOT library is an alternative implementation of the
  Ensemble HOT library using C-Ensemble.  This allows many
  applications build using the Ensemble HOT library to migrate to
  C-Ensemble.

  [NOTE: There are bugs in the pthreads library that is distributed in
  glibc with RedHat-6.1.  Be sure to use RedHat-6.2.]

  Building the C-Ensemble HOT library requires access to some of the
  Ensemble Hot modules:

  * Install and build the Ensemble hot library with 'make hot'

  * Set the ENS_ROOT in censemble/Makefile to be the path to the
    Ensemble distribution directory.  This needs to be set so that
    HOTDIR (defined relative to ENS_ROOT) points to the directory
    with the compiled HOT object files.

  * Run 'make demo/hot_test' in the censemble directory.

  * This should build the hot_test program in the demo directory as
    well as leave the library file libhot.a in the censemble/lib
    directory.
