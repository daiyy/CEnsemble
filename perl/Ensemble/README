This directory contains an interface to use CEnsemble in Perl
programs.  This is an initial release of the interface and it is
still very much alpha-quality.  There are known memory leaks and
missing pieces in the interface.  As with all of CEnsemble, we would
be happy to integrate extensions that others add.

* This Perl module makes use of optional 64-bit integer support in
  Perl.  On 32-bit architectures, this support is not enabled by
  default.  So, you will need to build Perl with this option enabled
  Build Perl-5.6, with '-Duse64bitints'.  Download a source
  distribution of Perl (eg., from www.perl.com).

    % <unpack perl-5.6.0.tgz>
    % cd perl-5.6.0
    % ./Configure -d -Dprefix=/home/$USER/Perl-5.6 -Doptimize=-g -Duse64bitints
    % make
    % make install

* Build CEnsemble perl module

    % cd censemble/perl/Ensemble
    % /home/$USER/Perl-5.6/bin/perl Makefile.PL
    % make

* Run sample test (a perl-ized verision of demo/rand.c test)

    % /home/hayden/Perl-5.6/bin/perl test.pl
